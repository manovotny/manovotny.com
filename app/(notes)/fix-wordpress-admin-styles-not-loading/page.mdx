After setting up my new computer and getting [MAMP Pro](https://www.mamp.info) running, I tried launching a WordPress project. The admin panel came up, but without any styles.

I tried reinstalling WordPress. No change. I spent a few hours digging through forums, trying countless suggestions. Eventually, something worked.

Open `wp-admin/load-styles.php` and find this line:

```php
error_reporting(0);
```

And change it to:

```php
error_reporting( E_ALL | E_STRICT );
```

After page refresh, the admin styles were back. I even switched the line back to its previous value, and everything still worked. Normally, I discourage editing WordPress core files, but I just needed to get back to work. Fortunately, you don't have to leave the change in place.

Someone else later mentioned you can add this code above any `require_once` calls in `wp-config.php` instead of modifying a WordPress core file:

```php
define( ‘CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS’, false );
define( ‘SCRIPT_DEBUG’, true );
```

I’m not sure _why_ any of this works. If you know, [tell me](https://x.com/intent/post?screen_name=manovotny). I'm curious.

For what it’s worth, I’ve never seen the issue again. If it ever happens again, I'll take the time to root cause the and submit a patch.
